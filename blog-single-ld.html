                    <p><h5>Your passion</h5></p>

                    <p class="mb-30"> 2004. A blank sheet of paper and an unassuming pencil.<br> Fast forward.<br> 2018. A tuckered out computer screen emulating the freshness of a “New Document” and the abashed cursor. <br>
I started writing when I was 7, stories of dragons and magic. Now, when I write, it is usually still stories, just fashioned to look like assignments and presentations. The magic remains, although in a form very different from what I knew magic to be at 7. I truly believe words are the most inexhaustible source of magic. So, I seek it out amidst all the stark realism around, every chance I get. And hopefully, a day will come when this very magic will be my reality.</p>

                    <p><h5>Your pet peeve</h5></p>
                    <p class="mb-30">My irrational dislike towards odd numbers is perhaps my biggest pet peeve. I perceive numbers subjectively and odd numbers simply make me uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p><h5>Your favourite movie</h5></p>
                    <p class="mb-30">My favourite movie of all time is <b>The Sound of Music</b>. It was the first non-animated movie I watched as a kid and since then I have watched it at least 10 times. Strangely, every time I watch it, I discover new aspects of the story that I had missed before. It is as if the movie opens up to me layer by layer.
The Sound of Music is also exceptionally close to my heart because the love for it is something my Mom and I have in common, that I don’t need to share with anyone else in the world. She watched it for the first time when she was a kid and it’s as if she has passed it on to me as an heirloom. </p>
                    <p><h5>Your favourite website</h5></p>
                    <p class="mb-30">My favourite website would have to be <b>Netflix</b>. The content available on Netflix is undeniably superlative, but what appeals to me the most about this platform is how unique and cutting edge its marketing strategy is. It is one company that truly relies heavily on consumer insights, and responds effectively to consumer demands, be it with the introduction of Netflix Socks or just simply embracing the meme-culture and trolling itself on Twitter to join the modern conversation.
Netflix knows its viewers better than they know themselves and uses it skilfully to align their content with the appropriate target groups.
Netflix, to me, is not just a website to binge my favourite shows on. It is a platform from which I derive invaluable lessons in effective utilisation of knowledge of consumer behaviour and engagement in the modern context.</p>
                    <p><h5>Your favourite phone application</h5></p>
                    <p class="mb-30"><b>Pinterest</b> is my go-to application. Be it the latest fashion trends or just abstractions, Pinterest never disappoints to present to me the most artfully appealing images. I believe this application has been instrumental in moulding my tastes and preferences towards minimalist design and it has brought out in me a side, which truly appreciates the power of visual appeal and aesthetics.</p>
                    <p><h5>A trend or fad that you can’t stand</h5></p>
                    <p class="mb-30">It is often considered cool to not be a feminist. This, of course, has nothing to do with the actual definition of the term, which advocates equality for men and women. This refers to what some people think feminism is about – male-bashing, random privileges given to women in the name of equality, and listening to Beyoncé’s music.
‘Feminism’ is often treated as a tabooed word and this is highly counterproductive to the cause of securing equal social, economic and political rights for people, regardless of their gender. It is time we erased these blurred lines that hinder a holistic understanding of feminism, do away with the trend of not being a feminist, and champion feminism for what it truly stands.</p>
